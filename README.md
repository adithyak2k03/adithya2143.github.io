Project for Saarang , a Cultural event conducted by IIT-M. Designed this as a completition to secure membership in a Web Development role in a Club.
Was not successful as the website is not responsive, but i learned from my mistakes.

Mistakes: 
-  Not responsive
-  Color choices are poor(learn color theory)
-  Backgrounds not related to the theme given.
-  Poor design
